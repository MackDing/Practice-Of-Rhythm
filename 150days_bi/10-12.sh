Great,now my chest hurts.-What
My chest hurts
Mom,I've given this a lot of thought
Okay,I have a question
Yes,Penny
You don't even like people touching you
How are you going to have sex
Okay,look,Ross,I realize my father is difficult
But that's why you have got to be the bigger man here
Look,sweetie,I could be the bigger man
I could be the biggest man
I could be a big,huge,giant man
and it still wouldn't make any difference
I am smart,I'm capable,
and I can make a difference
You're thinking about this way too much
Just tell him and get it over with
I'm s... Uh...C-Can we help you?
 Name's Murray Clark
I grew up in this house
Oh!hi!-Oh！
Well,my name is Cameron.This is my husband,Mitchell
Well,that's funny
She grew up without her dad
Don't treat me like a child,treat me like a colleague.
It was awful
All weekend,I was treated like a plus one
a second class citizen,a--
A wife!
I love san francisco
I wish I was going with you
I understand your envy
As you know,I'm a lawyer
Well,count me out
What?why?
Come on,I'm smart,
I have a good job and I have only three percent body fat
It's true
I've seen him at the beach
He's like a human chicken wing
Ladies and gentlemen,I hold in my hand the final question
"Howard，help me out of that tub
I'm stuck again"
I think it's time for you to forget about Rose
move on with your life
Okay,fine,fine,all right
You want to win by cheating,go ahead,all right
It's been 10 years,and I can't move on from you
I'm sorry,I've been doing this for 7 years
Trust me,you have to have eyes in the back of your head
It's because I planned ahead
I finished my Christmas shopping weeks ago
My tie is gone!My tie is gone!
Shelly,you don't really need a tie
I have to find my tie.I have to find my tie.
Amy！You can't go out tonight
She told it to me
 February 14,1982
I was 23 months old,it was Valentine's Day
and Mom and Dad went out for dinner
You were there.Don't you remember?
Janice.Hi,Janice.
Ok,here we go.I don't think we should go out anymore
I went to that diner,and...
I saw Rob kiss the waitress
Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman
Well,he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with
Bree asked me to join her company
Yeah?Hey,that's great
You must be exhausted
No,I'm not tired at all
You have no idea how much this hurts
I don't even like comic books
Yeah,me neither
This woman,was she wearing a lot of makeup?
She was.
How did you know that
I don't know.-You're smart girl
Try a little harder.-I said I don't know
I think I can make a difference
Now's not the time,Joey.You can yell at me tomorrow
Wait,no,Pheebs.I'm not gonna yell at you
All right,let's just get this stupid game over with
Great.I'll go first.-Okay
Because I grew up with a crazy mom
and two sisters to take care of
did i ever tell you about my father?
you want me to treat you like an adult,you got it
My grandmother still treats my dad like a child
Look,I'm not asking you to believe what I believe
I'm just asking you to think about what you believe
Well,I really envy your relationship
Manny...as you know,
your mother and Jorge had a relationship
Shut up.I'm counting pills
What about that girl last year at comic- con
Doesn't count
Why not？
Oh，my God.This doesn't count.Okay?
The interview was over
That was the real Chandler Being in there
This is just some crazy guy out in the hall
I mean I'm probably 98% happy and maybe 2% jealous
Alright.Final lesson...always be willing to walk away
I do not want you to give me a fake grade
It doesn't mean anything if you're lying
but,I was kind of hoping you could change my grade
Sometimes in life,you just get stuck
I think you'd be great at it.Really.
What?
He said you were a coal digger
Okay.I think we can move on
Well,uh,the thing is,the date didn't go that well
Oh,too bad
I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up
Dust yourself off,forget it and move on
I can't do that
Why the hell not
You can't ask us,son.That's cheating.
Good morning,Penny
What,do you have eyes in the back of your head?
Rise and shine,Papa
The clouds are gone
Well,maybe you and I go out for drinks
You say you went out with him for, like,a year.
Do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now
Well,my mom told me that Mr. Grove
went to the hospital last night
I just wanted to see how he was doing
Okay and I can also speak a little French
Well,he's going to Europe for the summer
and he wants me to join him
Did you just join this family
The kid's an oddball
Tom and I went out once
What's going on?-Chandler's gone again
You want to finish this job quickly
and move on to the next one,and it's easier
to put the window there instead of where I want it
Well,you were fired
No
I told that guy who answered your phone
I didn't get that message
So this doesn't count
Anyway,I'll be in my office
Baby,you're exhausted
and you need to go to sleep right now
Come with me.Come with me.
You okay
Something hurts
In fact,I gave it a lot of thought,
and I decided it was time for us to live together
I'm trying
Try harder
Hi,honey.Is your brother around?I need to yell at him
Of course he's around
Can we just get this over with?I have a spray tan at 4:00
“somewhere”?
You don't know where your husband grew up
Did you ever go to a school dance
Come on.That's how you treat a maid,not your wife
So...you take me to dinner
treat me like a lady
and bring me flowers
Shelly,I am asking you to do this for me
How I envy you
let's start
As you know,Max and I are part owners of the diner
Huh？
As you know,the school talent show is coming up
Jenny's playing the violin.What's Juanita going to do
Well,that's hard to say
You did it twice?
The first time didn't really count.You know,it was Barry
Remember,show your work
I'm afraid if I blink,my eyes will get stuck
Oh,my God,you're cheating.-No
That's thinking ahead
It was here on my desk and now it's gone
I have to go out for orange juice
Yes,I understand
I have to go out for orange juice
Mitchell
I have to go out for orange juice
Come on,you think she should go out with me,don't you
We went to her brother's restaurant
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street
Come on,let's join the party
Oh,man,this hurts
I've given it a lot of thought
In fact...
I bought this for you last night
I hope it's okay
Yeah,well,y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder
She's just using you to yell at us
Come on,let's just get this over with
Let's get this over with.
Did she ever say anything about my garden
Oleg,come on,film the room
I want our baby to know that I was treated like a queen
You're asking me to keep a secret
Yeah
I envy you your childhood
Rachel,if you want to go out with him,you can
Wendy,I tried
Well,try harder
Don't yell at me
I've got to go to the emergency room
Now?
Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school
Karen Berberick?
She loved you
She treated me like trash
Yep.Count me in.See you at the airport
Oh,hold on!-Ohh!
My ex-wife took 50% of my stuff
and left me 100% of my kids
Is that your final decision
It is
Very well
Hi,can you help me
I was writing an e-mail on the "a" key got stuck
Now it's just going "aaa..."
So,what'd he do？
#（what’d=what did口语写法，并不规范）
Did he cheat on a test?He's a cheater
He did not cheat on a test
See?This is why I ask you to think ahead,okay
is everybody gone?
Your mother was the last to leave
Be best friends with you?Go out with you
Have a baby with you?
Okay...Well,I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like
Well,if you went to the library
why don't you have any books?
I'm not just tired.I'm exhausted
Everything hurts
I get up in the morning
to do this job I don't even like
And I'm doing it just for the money
and it's not even a lot of money
I keep trying harder and harder
and it doesn't even make a difference
So if you're going to yell at me or punish me
let's just get it over with
Did I ever tell you I grew up poor
My whole family was treated like trash
So,one day I asked God to make me rich and beautiful
So people would envy me
Take one and pass it back
Take one and pass it back
As you all know,this test'll count for 25% of your final grade
Be sure to show all your work
If you get stuck on a question
move on and come back to it at the end
And I shouldn't have to say this,
but if there's any cheating,I will see it
I got eyes in the back of my head
I got more eyes than a potato
Ms.Ingram?
Yeah,Sheldon
I'm done
What?
I enjoyed it very much
I'll take another if you have one
No,I don't have another one
J-Just read ahead in the textbook
Oh,boy
Where's your dad?His car's gone
Uh,he and Renee went out to dinner
He and Renee?
Yeah.They went to that french restaurant dad likes.
They said you could join them if you want
Oh,I want
