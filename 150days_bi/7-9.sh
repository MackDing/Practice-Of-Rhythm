Okay look
You're right
I don't have many friends
so I was hoping to get to know Paige's mom
But if it makes you uncomfortable
then I will call her and cancel
I'll think about it
Thank you,baby
Guilt and jealousy in the same day
I slept hard that night
It's weird,right?
A grown man in his 30s living with my mother
That is weird
I thought he was，like，45
Hello,Janice.Hi.
I'm so glad that you called
I know I've been acting really weird lately
and it's just because I'm crazy about you
and I just got stupid and scared
and stupid a couple of more times
And I'm sorry
Really?
Really?
Honey,just put on something else
and take down the makeup
Why are you guys acting like this is my fault
Everybody was drinking,everybody ran.
I just got caught
If anything,I'm the victim here
What?!Just stop just stop talking,Haley.
That would make me very happy
I just want a chance to get to know you
Well,I don't want to know you
Um,okay,like,five or six
I thought we were friends
Oh,thank you,but maybe I should cancel
It's too late to cancel.You're going.
But I don't know anything about pharmaceuticals
So you're feeling guilty
Very much so
Well,don't be jealous,babe
Take off your shirt
What?Fine.
What do you mean
Everyone is acting weird
You can try,but you'll never catch me
Edie.Um,I'm not embarrassed
If anything,I'm flattered
She's a victim.I hate victims
Phil
I'm so glad that you're here
You know,I've been thinking lately
that maybe I don't want kids
Are you crazy? 
Of course you want them.It's amazing
No.You're crazy about me
Every time the phone rings,I get scared.
Me,too.
So good news
We're gonna have a houseguest for a couple days
Oh,not Aunt Ruth
So take it off
Fine
Oh,my god!Put on a shirt
I don't know what you want from me
All right,check your numbers!Make me rich.
Anyway,he doesn't drive
Maybe one day he'll take a bus and you'll get to meet him
So,like,you guys all have jobs?
Oh,God,here he comes
Who?
This little guy in his 40s here every friday
I'm not a child
I've grown up and I-I've learned some things
Well,I-I haven't met her yet
but her name is Anu
My father says she comes from a good family
She's in her 30s
Well,I-I haven't met her yet
but her name is Anu
My father says she comes from a good family
She's in her 30s
Although I was hoping to have sex tonight
You see?Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable
You and my wife are friends
That's why it's weird,George
But nothing actually happened
There's no reason to feel guilty
You could ask,but I won't tell
Why not?
Cause it's embarrassing
Karl,did you cheat again
No
Did she cheat
No
You finally saw her without her makeup
Susan!
I'm sorry
My God.Why are you acting like this
I haven't done anything wrong
let me say it again:I ran.
Yeah,but you're making me look bad
No I'm not.No!If anything I'm making you look better
Well,you've been so distant lately
Yeah.Something tells me she's not crazy about me
Yeah.Something tells me that,too, and it was her
Okay,run,run.Come on.Come on!
Knock,knock!Quick!
Take off your dress.He won't notice the bed
And you'll finally get to meet Rob
What?
I'm a grown man who can make his own decisions
You love this place
Holy moly 
It's good,huh?
Unbelievable
Yeah,when I was,like,eight.
Well,I was hoping to avoid this
Karl
you're making Tommy uncomfortable
The last time I slept with your husband
was the day your child died
Can I put makeup on you
Why does everyone ask me that
I met Victor three months ago.I mean,I'm crazy about him
It's just that I've been so tired lately
Actually,I've been playing a lot of love songs lately
I should put on pants
Our boys have grown up.I--uh...
Let me just get one shot
He's had so many girlfriends
The last one was a woman in her 20s
It's,like,50 bucks a night
Give me the phone
I thought you wanted to cancel
Great.I have a monster.
I'm sure you're mistaken
Nope.And we have to catch him before I go to bed tonight
I'm not judging you,
I'm just teasing.
If anything,I'm happy for us.Drink?
Brandy.What do you mean you're happy for us?
Mom,you're not crazy about Dad.
I don't know,I could maybe go out for a couple of beers.
Oh,my God,are you kidding?
Ross is so crazy about you...
...and I really wanted you to like me,and I...
Hey,what are you guys doing here?
We're grown men
we drink at bars.
I'm pumping!
It's Penny.
Oh.Come in.
I thought you were pumping
I thought you were my boss
Actually,I was hoping to speak with you.
Is this a good time?
Aw,she'll be okay.
She's a grown woman.-I know.
But he's only in his 30s.
That's young.
I hope you have a nice dinner
You have a girlfriend now.
A little jealous sorry?
No I'm not jealous.
Maybe you need sex.I had sex a couple days ago.
Well,when I was in high school,
you were in your 30s,
so...
Hope to see you tomorrow,chef.
I can't help it.She makes me crazy.
Listen,I'm sorry.I don't want to make you uncomfortable...
but I told Phoebe that it happened,and she doesn't believe me
that maybe-maybe you're jealous of her?
-What?What?-It's just-
No,Phoebe,I'm not letting you put makeup on my baby
Why not?
Because I already did.
Are we sure about this?I mean,if we get caught...
Yes.It's very risky.
How did the victim die?
Oh.They just needed to get to know one another better.
I am so glad that we did this.
Yeah,me,too.
I've been feeling a lot of stress lately
Yeah.
I started when I was a teenager.
I hope to have a very happy life in this house
I need to get to know you again
I was just trying to make you happy
Well,I wouldn't want you to feel uncomfortable.
Yeah,you would.
I just feel so guilty
I know people will be disappointed
No,no,don't feel guilty
You're not jealous of Leonard,are you?
Me?No.
Daddy slept in my room last night.
You are gonna take off my clothes.
Wow!They must put a lot of makeup on you.
Whose house is this?
Carrie Fisher.
And she's a little crazy,
so get ready to run
Okay,so here's the truth.
Your sister was caught drinking.
You're right.I am a victim.
Thank you for understanding.
I'm glad that you came
He's been very grumpy lately
I mean,I'm crazy about Pete.
And I know that we want the same things.
And when I thought about saying yes...
...it made me really happy.
Oh,my God!
Do you have any idea how scared I am?
You don't have it.-What?
...six more times!
I just decided to stay in town a couple more days.
Ross,please.Don't be so scared of him.
I am not scared of him.I'm really sick.
He's really cute.How do you know him?
Oh,we went out a couple of times.
In my 20s,I went on a game show
You cried for,like,seven months.
Sheldon,I understand you hope to be a scientist someday.
Yes,sir.
Chandler.-Where is she?
I'm not scared of you
So,you know,when's he getting back?
A couple of days.-Know what?
Hmm.Well,I have been pretty busy lately.
Can't you just try it one more time, Ross?
For me?For me?
Thanks.I'm crazy about our place.
My mother's texting you
Yeah.We've been talking a lot lately.
Why?
So what are you saying?You're the victim here?
We're so glad that you're here.
If I ever catch you drinking again,
your whole school is going to see this picture.
I got caught two blocks away from her house
My mother caught me.She was so angry.
George just ran to pick up some beers.
What is wrong with you?
You're acting like you're drunk.
Am I?
Take off your clothes.
What?Here?Now?
Yeah.You got a problem with that? -No,no.
take some of your makeup off.
I'm not wearing any makeup
If you find this cold,then put on the jacket.
Nice.I-I'm actually jealous of you
I slept with Monica
So you wanna try it?
I don't know.I'm still feeling guilty.
It's Reuben's helicopter
I...forgot to cancel it.
Yeah,and I know this--this makes you very sad,
Wait,this seat is really uncomfortable.
Hey,I have an idea.
Let's get to know the house,huh?
What?
You slept with someone else?
Put your shoes on.
Why?
Oh,my god!Take off my sweater!
Mom,tell her just take it off.
Alex,take it off.
Well,just put on a little makeup.
I just can't wait to see this one without makeup.
Stop acting like you're the only one with a job.
Gloria!
She ran to the store
Ok,you caught me.
Oh,she got caught drinking at some party
Aw.Are you worried?
I am not worried.
If anything,I'm overconfident.
It was entrapment.I'm the victim here.
But you were with a prostitute
I'm so glad that we can finally talk about it.
You've been working so much lately,
I'm glad you didn't forget about date night
Of course.
Maybe I've just been stressed lately, but I was wrong.
Uh,Bernadette said
you weren't crazy about the book
No.It's great.
I'm scared!-It's gonna be okay.
I'm not scared of Catherine
Come on,you guys.One more time.
Just give me a couple of minutes.
Hey,I'm a grown man
I'm gonna live with my wife.
Listen,everybody's broke in their 20s.
I thought you might want to apologize
Okay,Howard's mother is in,like,every one of your wedding photos.
What?-I hope we can still be friends.
Are you going home?
I was hoping to get to know you better.
Ah,your sadness makes me happy.
If you're uncomfortable,we can stop.
You need to call her and cancel.
Me?-Yes.
What should I tell her?-I don't know
Tell her I'm sick.-Okay.
So you don't feel guilty?-For what?
Jealousy?What do I have to be jealous of?
You stay young.
I'm the one who needs to grow up.
