Han,you can't let your mommy keep bullying you

It was at this moment I learned
I was not only brilliant,I was also hilarious

Hey,girls
Raise your hand if you're super depressed today

I don't understand.What's he doing here
I invited him
On our date
Sheldon,that's not okay
Yes,it is
There's a loophole in the Relationship Agreement
You found a loophole

You are not allowed to laugh at my joke
Oh,Sheldon
So nice to see you
I think you tripped and hit your head
I'm a bit woozy
Sweetheart,we love you just as much as Ross
I'm willing to take our relationship to the next level
You know,what was a complete misunderstanding
We thought we had a monkey,but we didn't
That is a complete waste of money
Don't you have any self-control
I'm sorry.Who are you
I'm a professor here.Ross Geller
Your store sucks
Sheldon,it's just a fun scary story
It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex
I've missed you
Is dinner ready
Uh...not yet
Honey,relax
She's not here yet
Don't you know it yet
You love me,Chandler Bing
Hey,Howard,uh,how's the Wi-Fi in the garage
I don't know
Why are you asking all these questions
What are you doing
Help！This man just attacked us
He is my son,too
Not exactly
Oh.Are you mad
No,not exactly
I'm just...
I'm trying to understand why you...
did that
Uh,I should let you know
I've read a book on jiu-jitsu
Oh,no,I tripped!Walking is so hard!
Yeah,and I want to trip you
I crushed his little body when I fell
See,Max
 This is what happens when you don't deal with your feelings
No,I'll deal with him
You keep going
Since you were born in Germany
I thought we could talk about German flags
I see you're reading a book on philosophy by Aristotle
If you don't mind,I could use your help with the cups
How about that
After all these years,your big bad high school bully
finally apologizes
So,did you see Howard's costume
See it?I made it.it was hilarious
Well,Sheldon didn't think so,and neither did I
I know I could help her
And she's my girlfriend...
I-I should be allowed to help her
Why aren't I allowed to help her
Yeah,I hear you,brother
Ma!Mikey hit me
What am I,your bodyguard?
Hit him back
So...
You're willing...
to give up salt
I'm willing to give up anything
Welcome to the real world
It sucks.You're gonna love it
It's just a spider.Calm down
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve!What are you gonna do
I thought we were best friends
We are
That's why I'm sad my best friend's gonna be homeless
I'm sorry Raj.We really just don't have the space
What if he lives in your garage
What if you stop helping
Guys,I'm not living in a garage
So?Bring the dog back.You're a hero
Yeah,I could be a hero.I could do that
What if it attacks me
Chandler,it's like a big gerbil
And that doesn't scare you
Oh,I tripped
Someone call a lawyer
Wait! -What?
Let's go to lunch
I can't go to lunch
Right
Oh,good God,I've fallen down
No,I'll deal with Nicholas later
You sure？
Because I don't know what's real
What does that mean
Dreaming and waking.Life and death
Philosophers and butterflies.They're all the same
I know.I was hoping to get a funny video of her falling
But I don't think it's gonna happen
Oh,look,it's just a meeting
I just...I want to be around her as much as I can
Stop it
You hit me
You saw that.He hit me
Nothing to worry about
He just hit his head
Did Dee speak with you
no.I haven't seen her all day
 But I'm working a case
and I could use your help
Your brother bullied you
The Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu believed
it was possible he didn't really know anything
because he might just be a butterfly
dreaming that he was a philosopher
And get this,Gerald fell again
Wow,somebody smoked out here
My God,don't people know
you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces
What?-Apparently,she fell in the shower and hit her head
Oh,my God.She's so stupid
Come on,let's talk about our lives
Tell me something about you I don't know
I own nine pairs of underpants
Okay,that-that's a good start
but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal
I see
I own nine pairs of underpants
I just,I don't understand
How could she do this
Am I like a complete idiot for thinking she'd actually show up
No
The philosopher Henri Bergson says
it's funny when a human being behaves like an object
No,no.She's--she's crazy
I mean,I saw her attack the vending machine
I could really use your help
Sorry,I can't
Come on,don't be like that
You're the one who's gonna lose her driving privileges
I don't know why you're so calm
Listen,sorry about your death,that really sucks
Ay.What happened
Did he fall
How could he fall
Honey,I'm so sorry,but it looks like
I'll be here all night
What?Well,how about I come up there
No,honey,please
I just have too much to deal with
Monica,I feel like you should have German subtitles
We did raise the roof that night
Yeah,we totally did
Hello?Ross -Hey
Oh,my God.Ross,are you in England?Was Emily surprised
No,because she hasn't come home yet
And she hasn't been home all night
She's obviously staying with that other guy
And I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment
Uh,Jay?
Your wife's upstairs
You don't have to hide in the garage anymore
I'm not hiding
Close the door,will you
I should get going
My philosophy class starts in a few minutes
I am a chauffeur,a chef,
Uh,a house manager,
A nurse.-Is it what you always wanted to do
No.Not exactly
but...just be careful and respectful
And you did break a big rule,
so no car privileges for a month
Phil,can I go in the garage
Make yourself at home,sister
Welcome to the world of philosophy
Honey,I could really use your help
with spring cleaning today
I got to get all these boxes down to the donation center
Hey,Peach
Max,I have the most incredible news
Lawyer finally found a loophole in your prenup
I wish,no
What's this philosophy teacher's name
Professor Ericson.-Why?
Todd? - Todd
Todd was the name of my bully
I hit her in the eye!I hit her in the eye
This is the worst break-up in the history of the world
Oh my God
Just do it.There's a big inspection coming up
and I don't want to lose my TV privileges
Uh,Ben likes me.He just doesn't know it yet
Well,it's good to have a personal philosophy
Andrew,who is he
He may be the one that attacked her
Let's just buy our stuff and go
So,I could really use your help
making it look more professional
I don't... oh...
What's the word I'm looking for
I'm not going to help you.This is hilarious
Dunphy,you're in my spot again
That's her.-She's your bully
Then why didn't you raise your hand
Cause I don't care
Next question
Am I allowed to drink anything? -Ice chips.just ice chips
They're at the nurses' station. -I'll get it
No,I'll get it. -No,I'm getting it
The good news is
I'm willing to help you
If you'd really like to see this movie
I'm willing to drive you
Maybe we could meet your friends there
I don't want my mommy to take me
But if you really think marrying this woman
is gonna make you happy
then you have my complete and total support
Yeah,well,sorry,Joe
You said let's just be friends,so guess what
What?-
We're just friends
Do you hear that?I think Celia fell down
Gaby
The class is called"Introduction to Philosophy."
That's what I did
And then I--Oh--
tripped and fell and skinned my knee
and everybody saw my underwear
Is that my journal
Uh,she just found it,
but she hasn't read it yet
Professor Geller? -Yeah?
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class
Oh,thank you.Thanks very much
The man's incapable of self-control
Happy holidays to my dear Amy
I hope you treasure this
as much as I treasure you
Han,you have to face this bully
The other thinks it's hilarious
and a great idea
Ooh,raise the roof,Lily.Yeah.
Which Dairy Queen
What are you talkin' about
There's two
Really
You're gonna hit it
Which is the one Mom takes us to
You're gonna hit it
Ooh,you're in trouble now
Well,maybe that's because his mama didn't love him
as much as I love you
So,I had a little bit of a self-control problem
What?Why
He's moving to Portland
His parents got back together
Oh,that sucks. -I know
Let's just have a nice,quiet dinner
You know I never attacked her
They're mean
One of them tried to trip me
Yeah,that was me
I am so glad I don't have to deal with this kind of stuff anymore
No,that's my girlfriend,Caroline
That sucks for you,dude
Exactly.You love Amy as much as I do
Kind of funny
Hilarious
You're gonna love him.Trust me
The guy's hilarious
You are dancing with the tall guy over there
Tall guy,raise your hand
All right,it's time to raise the roof
You're not allowed to judge me
What if it hits us and we all die
It's not gonna hit us
I might hit you
Really?Is this still happening
I'm willing to make up,but someone's being a baby
But you're gambling with our life savings
and you have no experience
Well,there you go...
complete waste of our time
See?Trying is embarrassing
So,since I have such strong self- control,
there's really no reason for us to end our friendship
Sanjay's dad's a surgeon.His mom's a professor
I can't compete with that
Come on,it's just a video game
What are you doing
Valentine's Day isn't over yet， Juliana
Maybe it's in one of the boxes in the garage
Joe,relax
Animals don't attack people for no reason
I asked you before if you were in love with her
I-I know,I know
You lied to me. -Not exactly
We'll talk about that later,right now,I need you to take some medicine
Are we sick
Not exactly.This is a special kind of medicine
It's like a vitamin and you'll take it every day,ok?
Okay,Mitchell,I'm gonna teach you
a couple of basic Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu moves
Now,just attack me
Pheebs,Monica tripped me
I don't think I can ever run again, ever
Wait,so you're going
Well,okay,I have to.I can't deal with this right now
Missy,I could really use your help
With what
I'm being bullied by Bobbi Sparks
Hilarious.Go on
Mom says a man should never raise his hand to a woman
But I believe I've found a loophole
You're a woman,so you're allowed to hit her as much as you want
Why would I do that
Because I'm willing to pay you
How much
My life savings,four dollars
That's a good start
Now,let's talk TV privileges
What do you want
Complete control every afternoon for two months
That's when Professor Proton is on
I know.Sucks for you
Shelly,it's just Bactine
I didn't even put it on you yet
You want to tell me what happened
Bobbi Sparks came into the garage...
And she attacked you
Not exactly.I tried to use jiu-jitsu on her
but I tripped and fell
Aw,baby.I'm so sorry you're havin' to deal with this
It's okay
German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche said,
“That which does not kill us makes us stronger.”
And do you feel stronger
No.
