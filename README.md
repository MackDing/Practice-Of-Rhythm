- KISS Principle (Keep it simple and easy to understand, avoid over-complexity.)
- DRY principle (Don't Duplicate Code): Avoid duplicating code, extract shared code sections to build reusable functions or modules.
- YAGNI Principle (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Don't design functionality that you think you might use in the future, but don't need now.
