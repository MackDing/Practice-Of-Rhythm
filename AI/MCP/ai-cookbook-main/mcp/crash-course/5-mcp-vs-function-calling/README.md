## Part 4: Comparing MCP to Traditional Approaches

### Side-by-Side Comparison

Let's compare our MCP implementation to a traditional function-calling approach in `function-calling.py`

At this small scale, the traditional approach is simpler. The key differences become apparent when:

1. **Scale increases**: With dozens of tools, the MCP approach provides better organization
2. **Reuse matters**: The MCP server can be used by multiple clients and applications
3. **Distribution is needed**: MCP provides standard mechanisms for remote operation

### When to Use MCP vs. Traditional Approaches

**Consider MCP when**:

- You need to share tool implementations across multiple applications
- You're building a distributed system with components on different machines
- You want to leverage existing MCP servers from the ecosystem
- You're building a product where standardization provides user benefits

**Traditional approaches may be better when**:

- You have a simpler, self-contained application
- Performance is critical (direct function calls have less overhead)
- You're early in development and rapid iteration is more important than standardization
