## Part 2: Understanding MCP at a Technical Level

### MCP Architecture Overview

The Model Context Protocol follows a client-host-server architecture:
This separation of concerns allows for modular, composable systems where each server can focus on a specific domain (like file access, web search, or database operations).

- **MCP Hosts**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or your python application that want to access data through MCP
- **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol (tools, resources, prompts)
- **Local Data Sources**: Your computer’s files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access
- **Remote Services**: External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to

This separation of concerns allows for modular, composable systems where each server can focus on a specific domain (like file access, web search, or database operations).

    ServerC -- Web APIs --> RemoteC
```

MCP defines three core primitives that servers can implement:

1. [Tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools#python): Model-controlled functions that LLMs can invoke (like API calls, computations)
2. [Resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources#python): Application-controlled data that provides context (like file contents, database records)
3. [Prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts#python): User-controlled templates for LLM interactions

For Python developers, the most immediately useful primitive is tools, which allow LLMs to perform actions programmatically.

### Transport Mechanisms Deep Dive

MCP supports two main transport mechanisms:

1. **Stdio (Standard IO)**: 
   - Communication occurs over standard input/output streams
   - Best for local integrations when the server and client are on the same machine
   - Simple setup with no network configuration required

2. **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**:
   - Uses HTTP for client-to-server communication and SSE for server-to-client
   - Suitable for remote connections across networks
   - Allows for distributed architectures

Understanding when to use each transport is crucial for building effective MCP implementations:

- Use **Stdio** when building single-application integrations or during development
- Use **SSE** when you need remote accessibility or are integrating with clients that require it

        Client1["MCP Client"]
        Server1["MCP Server"]
  end

        Server2["MCP Server"]
  end

  end
 subgraph Remote["Remote Deployment"]
        SSE
  end
    Client1 -- stdin/stdout<br>(bidirectional) --> Server1
    Client2 -- HTTP POST<br>(client to server) --> Server2
    Server2 -- SSE<br>(server to client) --> Client2
    style Client1 fill:#BBDEFB
    style Server1 fill:#BBDEFB
    style Client2 fill:#BBDEFB
    style Server2 fill:#E1BEE7
```

If you're familiar with FastAPI, you'll find that implementing an MCP server with SSE transport feels very similar. Both frameworks use HTTP endpoints for receiving requests and support streaming responses using Server-Sent Events. They both allow you to define handlers for specific routes/endpoints and provide async/await patterns for handling requests and generating responses. This similarity makes it easy for FastAPI developers to transition to building MCP servers, as they can leverage their existing knowledge of HTTP, async programming, and streaming responses.

### A New Standard

The true power of MCP isn't in introducing new capabilities, but in standardizing how these capabilities are exposed and consumed. This provides several key advantages:

- **Reusability**: Build a server once, use it with any MCP-compatible client
- **Composability**: Combine multiple servers to create complex capabilities
- **Ecosystem growth**: Benefit from servers created by others

The MCP ecosystem is already growing rapidly, with servers available many tools. You can find an overview here: [Officially supported servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)

This means you can leverage existing servers rather than reinventing the wheel, and contribute your own servers to benefit the community.
